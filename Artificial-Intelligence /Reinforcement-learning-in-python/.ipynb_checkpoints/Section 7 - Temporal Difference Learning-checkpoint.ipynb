    "# 1. Temporal Difference Learning Introduction\n",
    "We are now going to look at a third method for solving MDPs, _**Temporal Difference Learning**_. TD is one of the most important ideas in RL, and we will see how it combines ideas from the first two techniques, Dynamic Programming and Monte Carlo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that one of the disadvantages of DP was that it requires a full model of environment, and never learns from experience. On the other hand, we saw that MC does learn from experience, and we will shortly see that TD learns from experience as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the Monte Carlo method, we saw that we could only update the value function after completing an episode. On the other hand, DP uses bootstrapping and was able to improve its estimates based on existing estimates. We will see that TD learning also uses bootstrapping, and furthermore is fully online, so we don't need to wait for an episode to finish before we start updating our value estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will take our standard approach:\n",
    "> 1. First we will look at the prediction problem, aka finding the value function given a policy.\n",
    "2. Second we will look at the control problem. We will look at 2 different ways of approaching the control problem: **SARSA** and **Q-Learning**.  "

    "# 2. Prediction Problem - `TD(0)`\n",
    "We are now going to look at how to apply TD to the prediction problem, aka finding the value function. The reason that there is a 0 in the name is because there are other TD learning methods such as `TD(1)` and `TD(`${\\lambda}$`)`, but they are outside the scope of this course. They are similar, but not necessary to understand _Q-learning_ and _Approximation methods_, which is what we eventually want to get to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Monte Carlo Disadvantage\n",
    "One big disadvantage of Monte Carlo was that we needed to wait until the episode is finished before we can calculate the returns, since the return depends on all future rewards. Also, recall that the MC method is to average the returns, and that earlier in the course we looked at different ways of calculating averages. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 `TD(0)`\n",
    "In particular, we can look at the method that does not require us to store all of the returns: _the moving average_. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$Y_t = (1 - \\alpha)Y_{t-1} + \\alpha X_t$$\n",
    "#### $$Y_t = Y_{t-1} - \\alpha Y_{t-1} + \\alpha X_t$$\n",
    "#### $$Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \\alpha ( X_t - Y_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $\\alpha$ can be constant or decay with time. So, if we use this formula it would be an alternative way of caculating the average reward for a state. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(S_t) \\leftarrow V(S_t) + \\alpha \\big[G(t) - V(S_t)\\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotated:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/moving-average-TD.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we have chosen to not multiply the previous value by $1 - \\alpha$, and we have chosen to have $\\alpha$ be constant (instead of slowly get smaller over time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now recall the definition of $V$; it is the expected value of the return, given a state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(s) = E \\big[G(t) \\mid S_t = s\\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But, remember that we can also define it recursively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(s) = E \\big[R(t+1) + \\lambda V(S_{t+1}) \\mid S_t =s\\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is reasonable to ask if we can just replace the return in the update equation with this recursive definition of $V$! What we get from this, is the `TD(0)` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(S_t) = V(S_t) + \\alpha \\big[R(t+1) + \\lambda V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#0000cc\">$$\\text{TD(0)} \\rightarrow V(s) = V(s) + \\alpha \\big[r + \\lambda V(s') - V(s)\\big]$$</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see how this is fully online! We are not calculating $G$, the full return. Instead, we are just using another $V$ estimate, in particular the $V$ for the next state. What this also tells us is that we cannot update $V(s)$ until we know $V(s')$. So, rather than waiting for the entire episode to finish, we just need to wait until we reach the next state to update the value for the current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Sources of Randomness\n",
    "It is helpful to examine how these estimates work, and what the sources of randomness are. \n",
    "\n",
    "> * With MC, the randomness came from the fact that each episode could play out in a different way. So, the return for a state would be different if all the later state transitions had some randomness. \n",
    "* With **`TD(0)`** we have yet another source of randomness. In particular, we don't even know the return, so instead we use $r + \\gamma V(s')$ to estimate the return $G$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Summary\n",
    "We just looked at why `TD(0)` is advantageous in comparison to MC/DP. \n",
    "\n",
    "> * Unlike DP, we do not require a full model of the environment, we learn from experience, and only update V for states we visit.\n",
    "* Unlike MC, we don't need to wait for an episode to finish before we can start learning. This is advantageous in situations where we have very long episodes. We can improve our performance during the episode itself, rather than having to wait until the next episode.\n",
    "* It can even be used for continuous tasks, in which there are no episodes at all. "

    "We are now going to look at how to apply the `TD(0)` algorithm to the control problem. We are going to apply `TD(0)` to _policy iteration_. In particular, we are going to use the value iteration method, where we continually update $Q$ based on itself. We are going to do it in place, and any actions we take are always greedy with respect to our current estimate of $Q$. So, we will be skipping the part where we do a full policy evaluation, and just immediately going to the more efficient form. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the Monte Carlo section, that the reason we want to use $Q$ is because it allows us to choose an action based on the argmax of $Q$. We are not able to do this with $V$ because it is only indexed by the state. Since $Q$ has the same recursive form, we can apply the same update equation as before:\n",

    "Notice that we have the same limitation as we did with MC; since $Q$ is indexed by both state and action, we need many more iterations to gather enough data for convergence. Because the update depends on the 5-tuple (s,a,r,s',a') this method is called _**SARSA**_.  \n",
    "## 3.1 What Policy to use?\n",
    "Since SARSA requires us to know $Q(s,a)$ for all the possible actions $a$ in state $s$, so that we can accurately chose the argmax, we have the same problem as we did with MC. Recall, the problem was that if you follow a deterministic policy, you will only ever do $\\frac{1}{|A|}$ of the possible actions, which will leave most of $Q$ undefined. To fix this we either have to use exploring starts, or a policy that allows for exploration, like epsilon-greedy. Since we know that exploring starts is not realistic, we are going to use epsilon greedy. \n",

Therefore, the learning rate will decay for values of $Q$ that have never been updated before. You could try to remedy this by only decaying the learning rate once per episode, but you still have the same problem. Only a subset of the full set of states are going to be visited in the episode, and only one of the possible actions per state are going to be taken. So, even if you decay the learning rate once per episode, you will still be decaying the learning rate for parts of $Q$ that have never been updated before. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we take inspiration from deep learning; in particular the AdaGrad and RMSprop algorithms, which are both adaptive learning rates. Recall, what makes these unique is that the effective learning rates decrease more when past gradients have been large. In other words, the more something has changed in the past, the more we will decrease the learning rate in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our version will be simpler than these techniques, but the idea is the same. We are going to keep a count of how many times we have seen a state action pair (s, a). We will set $\\alpha$ to be the original $\\alpha$ divided by this count:\n",
