    "# 2. The Markov Property\n",
    "Let us first review the **Markov Property** in the strict mathematical sense. Suppose we have a sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$\\{x_1, x_2,...,x_t\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a conditional probability on $x_t$, given all the previous $x$'s:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p\\{x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, ..., x_1\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, this can't be simplified. However, if we assume that the markov property is true, than it can be simplified. The markov property specifies how many previous $x$'s the current $x$ depends on. So, **First-Order Markov** means that $x_t$ depends only on $x_{t-1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p\\{x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, ..., x_1\\} = p \\{x_t \\mid x_{t-1} \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Second Order Markov** means that $x_t$ only depends on $x_{t-1}$ and $x_{t-2}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p\\{x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, ..., x_1\\} = p \\{x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, x_{t-2} \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we will be working with the first order markove only, and we typically refer to this as *the markov property*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Simple Example\n",
    "Consider the sentence: **\"Let's do a simple example\"**. Let's say that you are given:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Let's do a simple\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it is relatively easy to guess that the next word is \"example\". Now, all we are given is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"simple\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not longer easy to predict the next word. This can be even hard! For instance, what if we were just given:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is _very_ difficult to predic the next word, \"simple\". Well, that is what the markov assumption is; we can clearly see that it can be quite limiting. However, we can also define the problem so that it is not. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Markov Property in RL\n",
    "So, what exactly does the markov property look like in RL? Recall, that taking an action $A(t)$ while in state $S(t)$ produces two things: the next state $S(t+1)$ and a reward $R(t+1)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$\\{S(t), A(t) \\} \\rightarrow \\{ S(t+1), R(t+1)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What the markov property in this case says, is that $S(t+1)$ and $R(t+1)$ depend only on $A(t)$ and $S(t)$, but not any $A$ or $S$ before that:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p\\big(S_{t+1}, R_{t+1} \\mid S_t, A_t, S_{t-1}, A_{t-1},...,S_0, A_0\\big) = p \\big( S_{t+1}, R_{t+1} \\mid S_t, A_t\\big) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we can also use the shorthand symbols we have mentioned earlier: $s, a,  r, s'$:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p(s', r \\mid s, a) = p(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r \\mid S_t = s, A_t = a)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "So, how is the different from the normal way that we usually write the markov property? Well, notice that this is a _joint distribution_ on $s'$ and $r$. So, it is telling us the joint distribution of two variables, conditioned on two other variables. This is different from the usual markov form, where we have one variable on the left, and one variable on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Other Conditional Distributions\n",
    "Given the above joint conditional distribution, it is of course just a matter of using the rules of probability to find the marginal and conditional distributions. For example, if we just want to know $s'$ given $s$ and $a$ we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p(s' \\mid s, a) = \\sum_{r \\in R}p(s', r \\mid s, a )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we just wanted to know $r$ given $s$ and $a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p(r \\mid s,a) = \\sum_{s' \\in S} p(s', r \\mid s, a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that for essentially all cases that we will consider, these probabilities will be deterministic. That means that the reward you get for going to the state will always be the same reward, and taking an action in a state will always take you to the same next state. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Is the Markov Assumption Limiting?\n",
    "Let's look at a recent application of RL to demonstrate that the markov assumption is not necessarily limiting. DeepMind used the concatenation of the 4 most recent frames in order to represent the current state when playing Atari games. "

    "# 3. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)\n",
    "We have essentially been looking at MDPs this entire time, but just not referring to them by name. Any RL task with a set of states, actions, and rewards, that follows the markov property is a markov decision process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally speaking, the MDP is a 5 tuple, made up of:\n",

    "## 3.1 Policy\n",
    "There is one final piece needed to complete our puzzle. The other key term in markov decission process is **decision**. The way that we make decisions, and chose what actions to take in what states, is called a policy. We generally denote the policy with the symbole $\\pi$. Technically, $\\pi$ is not part of the MDP itself, but it is part of the solution, along with the value function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we are just talking about the policy now is because it is somewhat of a weird symbol. We write down $\\pi$ as a mathematical symbol, but there is no equation for $\\pi$. For example, if $\\pi$ is epsilon-greedy, how do we write that as an equation? It is more like an algorithm. The only exception to this is when you want to write down the **optimal policy**, which can be defined mathematically, in terms of the *value function*; we will discuss this later. So, for now we can just think of $\\pi$ as the shorthand notation for the algorithm that the agent is using to navigate the environment. \n",

    "Let's look at the state transition probability again:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p(s' \\mid s, a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we said that this is typically deterministic, but that is not always the case. Why might that be so? Recall, that the state is only what is derived from what the agent senses from the environment; it is not the environment itself. The state can be an imperfect representation of the environment, in which case you would expect the state transition to be probabilistic. For example, the state you measure could represent multiple configurations of the environment. As an example of an imperfect representation of the environment, think about blackjack; you may think of the dealers next card as part of the state. But, as the agent, you can't see the next card so it is not part of your state. It _is_ part of the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Actions\n",
    "When we think of actions, we typically think of joystick inputs (up/down/left/right/jump) or blackjack moves (hit/stand). However, actions can be very broad as well, such as how to distribute government funding. So, RL can be applied to making political decisions as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Agent vs Environment\n",
    "Sometimes there is a bit of confusion surrounding what constitutes the agent vs. the environment. You are navigating your environment, but what constitutes you? Are you your body? Your body is, more correctly, part of the environment! Your body isn't making decisions or learning; your body has sensors which pass on signals to your brain, but it is your brain and mind that make all decisions and do all learning! "

Usually we choose something close to 1, such as 0.9. If we have a very short episodic task, it may not be worth discounting at all. An intuitive reason for discounting future rewards is that the further you look into the future, the harder it is to predict. Hence, there is not a lot of sense getting something 10 years from now, unless you are sure you can make it happen, and that your circumstances won't change. \n",

Pretend that there is a state transition from the terminal state to itself, that always happens with probability of 1, and always yields a reward of 0. In this way, the episodic task remains the same, but since it goes on forward, it is technically a continuous task. \n",

    "### 5.0 Expected Values\n",
    "The most important concept in understanding the bellman equation, is the **expected value**. This concept is strange to many people as first; here is why: suppose we have a coin that has heads and tails, where heads is a win, and tails is a loss. Numerically, we encode these as heads = 1 and tails = 0. Now suppose the probability of winning is 60%, i.e. P(win) = 60%. Our expected value is then:\n",

    "#### $$0.6 * 1 + 0.4 * 0 = 0.6$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.01 So what is the point?\n",
    "The point of an expected value is that it tells us its mean, or the average. We may be gathering the heights of students in a classroom and find the average height; perhaps no student has that height, it is still a useful statistic. Similarly, it doesn't matter if the coin flip will never yield 0.6. If we flip the coin 1000 times, we know to expect 600 wins! \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.02 Expected Value - Mathematical Definition\n",
    "We can define expected value to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$E(X) = \\sum_x p(x)x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.03 Why are averages so important\n",
    "Suppose we are playing the game of tic tac toe. Realistically, we can't perfectly predict what our opponent is going to do next. They can do any number of things, and sometimes we may end up winnings, other times losing. Each time, this will leave us with a different total reward. Again, we can use a tree to represent this idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tic-tac-toe-tree.png\" width=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also recall that trees are recursive. So, if we take the tree above, and look at one of the children nodes by the root, that is also called at tree! In other words, the child of any node in the tree, is the root of another tree! This idea of recursiveness will become very important later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, every time we play this game we are going to take a different path down the tree. Each path has a different probability, but we can still have this concept of:\n",
    "\n",
    "> _What is the weighted sum of total rewards I get with this tree, with these states and these probabilities._\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, the value of this state is precisely the **average reward** I will accumulate in the future, by being in this state now. Note this is not the _exact reward_, because that can be different every time. We are saying that it is the _average_, or what we would get on average if we chose that tree many times. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.1 The Value Function\n",
    "So, lets quickly recap what we know so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * At each state $s$, we are going to get a reward $R$.\n",
    "* The overall return, $G$, is the sum of all the rewards we get. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, games are random, so we need to be able to answer: \"If we are in state $s$, what is the sum of rewards we will get in the future, on average?\" To answer this we can say: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(s) = E( G \\mid s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In english this just means \"The value at state $s$ is equal to the expected value of the overall return, $G$, given that we are in state $s$.\" As a note, anything to the left of the $\\mid$ (given) symbol is random, while that to the right is not random. This is called a **conditional expectation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.2 Fundamental Concept\n",
    "The next concept we discuss is one of the most fundamental concepts in RL. The idea is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that every game is going to consist of a series of states and rewards:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rewards-states.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend for a moment that everything is deterministic, hence the reward we would get is the only reward we could possibly get at any state. This lets us drop the expected value symbol for now. You may recall, the expected value of a value that is not random, is just the value itself. I.e., the expected value of 3 is 3: $E(3) = 3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, because the value of a state is just the sum of all future rewards (if they are deterministic), we can say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(s_1) = r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + ... + r_N$$\n",
    "#### $$V(s_1) = r_3 + r_4 + ... + r_N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But, we can now see a special relationship between the values of successive states! In particular, we can plug in the expression for $V(s_2)$ into the expression for $V(s_1)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(s_1) = r_2 + V(s_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, this is a **recursive** equation! \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.1 Discounted Version\n",
    "Of course, if you wanted to discount future rewards, that can be done too without any significant changes. We can say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(s_1) = r_2 + \\gamma r_3 + \\gamma^2 r_4 + ...$$\n",
    "#### $$V(s_2) = r_3 + \\gamma r_4 + ... $$\n",
    "#### $$V(s_1) = r_2 + \\gamma V(s_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursiveness is going to be a _very_ important theme in this course. We know that this value function is going to be an expected value. And we know from our tic tac toe example that our job is to estimate this value. But we can see how it has this recursive structure. The value at this state is an estimate, and it depends on the value at another state-which is also an estimate. So, it is an estimate which itself depends on an estimate. This set of notebooks, in general, is all about how we optimize this array of estimates-which depend on eachother-all at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3 General Terms\n",
    "So, what can we do now that we have this relationship between the value at state $s$, and the value at state $s'$ (Notice that $s_1$ and $s_2$ have been replaced with $s$ and $s'$ just be more general). So:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **$s$ = current state**<br>\n",
    "**$s'$ = next state**\n",

    "> **$r$ = $R(s, s')$ = reward**\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, remember that we said that the rewards and state transitions can all be probabilistic. So, in order to denote that, we just put the expected value symbol back in our equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(s) = E \\Big[ r + \\gamma V(s')\\Big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the essence of the Bellman Equation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3.1 Expansion\n",
    "Since we can express $V(s)$ as an expected value, we can even expand it out:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(s) = E \\Big[ r + \\gamma E[r' + \\gamma V(s'')]\\Big]$$\n",
    "#### $$V(s) = E \\Big[ r + \\gamma E\\big[r' + \\gamma E[r''+...]\\big]\\Big]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### $$V(s) = E \\Big[ r + \\gamma V(s') \\mid s\\Big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3.3 Extension\n",
    "One useful function of the value function, $V$, which depends on $s$, is another value function $Q$. $Q$ not only depends on $s$, but also the action $a$. We call $V(s)$ the state-value function, and $Q(s,a)$ the action-value function:\n",

    "**Q(s,a) = action-value function**<br>\n",
    "What is my expected future return, given that I am now in state $s$ and I take action $a$? \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $Q$ provides a way of incorporating more data into the prediction, and provide more granularity. What this means is that since $V$ doesn't depend on $a$, it must somehow take it into account, we just don't know how yet. We will discuss this more in a later section!"

    "We will start with the most basic example: We have 2 states, _start_ and _end_. The probability of going from start to end is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bellman-ex-1.png\" width=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, every time we play this game it is completely deterministic. We can say that the end state gives us a reward of 1, and the discount factor is $\\gamma = 0.9$. The question is, what do we need to find? \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, we want to be solving for the value function! Because there are only two states, in particular we need to find $V(start)$ and $V(end)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we must first recall that the *value* is the _sum of all future rewards_. At the terminal state there are no longer any _future rewards_, meaning the value of a terminal state is 0. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(end) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that because everything else is deterministic:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this? Well, from an intuitive standpoint we can think of this as a probability tree. Since this is the only edge in that tree, the weight of the edge is 1, and the reward is 1, leaving us with one as our answer. This would still hold true when using the Bellman equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = V(s = start) = E\\big[ R(end) \\mid s = start\\big]$$\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = E \\big[1 \\mid start \\big]$$\n",
    "#### $$V(start) =1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that we do not multiply this by $\\gamma$, because $\\gamma$ only applies to future states. So, the full equation is technically:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = R + \\gamma V(end)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But the second term just resolves to 0. \n",

    "## 7.2 Example 2\n",

    "<img src=\"images/bellman-ex-2.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that everything is still deterministic, and every game just has 3 steps: start, middle, and end. The reward again is 1 for arriving in the end start, and 0 at the middle state. $\\gamma$ will remain at 0.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, our goal is to find $V(start)$, $V(middle)$, and $V(end)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because end is a terminal state, we again know its value is:\n",

    "#### $$V(end) = 0$$\n",

    "The middle state takes on the role that start did in example 1, so it is subsequently:\n",

    "#### $$V(middle) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use the bellman equation to determine the value of the start state:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = R(start, mid) + \\gamma V(mid) = 0 + 0.9 *1 = 0.9$$\n",

    "## 7.3 Example 3\n",

    "#### $$V(middle) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind, the reason that the value of the middle state did not change is because it is only effected by _future rewards_. And in the case of the start state:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = R(start, mid) + \\gamma V(mid) = 1*-0.1 + 0.9 *1 = 0.8$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.4 Example 4\n",
    "In this example, we are going to introduce some randomness:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bellman-ex-4.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Our states are $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$. $S_4$ is a terminal state, and you always get a reward of 1 when you go here. $S_2$ and $S_3$ always go to $S_4$ 100% of the time, so this part is deterministic. $S_1$ goes to $S_2$ 50% of the time, and to $S_3$ 50% of the time, hence this portion is random. The reward for $S_4$ is 1, for $S_2$ is -0.2, and for $S_3$ is -0.3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin trying to find a solution, it would be beneficial to clear up a potential nuance that was just introduced; what do the probabilities we are working with refer to? When we say \"there is a 50% chance of going to $S_2$ and a 50% chance of going to $S_3$\", what does that really man? Becuse this is reinforcement learning, and there are multiple components in an MDP, this is not just a simple coin flip. We don't flip a coin and go which way it tells us to go. We are an _intelligent agent_, and as such have an internal policy, $\\pi(a \\mid s)$, that tells us which action to take. So, importantly we should make clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\pi(a \\mid s)$ does not tell us _where to go_, but rather _what action to take_. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, we must recall that this is not the only relevant probability. We also have the probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p(s', r \\mid s, a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This just means that by doing some action $a$ in state $s$, the result can be random. So if the action is to flip a coin, of course there can be multiple possible results. We may get heads, or we may get tails. That is one way an action may result in a probabilistic next state. \n",
    "\n",
    "> $p(s', r \\mid s, a)$ tells us where we end up, after taking a certain action. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we say that there is a 50% chance of going to $S_2$ and a 50% chance of going to $S_3$, that sounds very intuitive and simple, but it oversimplifies MDP's and results in some ambiguity (although when you verbalize it, it sounds simpler). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, let's assume that $p(r,s' \\mid s,a)$ is deterministic, and the 50% probabilities mentioned earlier, refer to the policy $\\pi(a \\mid s)$, where the action is simply just to go to the next state. That means that the agent itself decides where to go by random chance, and it is not the result of the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, as before, our terminal state $S_4$ has a value of 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(S_4) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because moving from $S_2$ and $S_3$ is deterministic, they both have the same value as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(S_2) = 1$$\n",
    "#### $$V(S_3) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, $V(S_1)$ must be calculated using expected values:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(S_1) = p(S_2 \\mid S_1) \\big[R_2 + \\gamma V(S_2) \\big] + p(S_3 \\mid S_1) \\big[R_3 + \\gamma V(S_3) \\big]$$\n",
    "#### $$V(S_1) = 0.5 * \\big[-0.2 + 0.9 *1 \\big] + 0.5 * \\big[-0.3 + 0.9 *1 \\big] = 0.65$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.5 Example 5\n",
    "We will now extend the previous example a bit further. In example 4, the expected value was easy to calculate because we knew we would end up in the same terminal state $S_4$. In this example that won't be the case. Note that $S_1$ can go to either $S_2$ or $S_3$, and from $S_2$ and $S_3$ we can end up in either $S_4$ or $S_5$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bellman-ex-5.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now we have 2 terminal states, with multple paths to either one. The only relevant rewards for this example are +1 if we end up in $S_5$, and -1 if we end up in $S_4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that $S_4$ and $S_5$ are terminal states, hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(S_4) = 0$$\n",
    "#### $$V(S_5) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we can calculate $V(S_2)$ and $V(S_3)$ just from the rewards, just because we know the next state must be terminal (so we don't need to use the full bellman equation). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(S_2) = 0.8 * -1 + 0.2 * 1 = -0.6$$\n",
    "#### $$V(S_3) = 0.9*1 + 0.1*-1 = 0.8$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to determine $V(S_1)$ we must consider both $V(S_2)$ and $V(S_3)$. It is still simple, however, because the rewards at those states are 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(S_1) = p(S_2 \\mid S_1) \\big[R_2 + \\gamma V(S_2) \\big] + p(S_3 \\mid S_1) \\big[R_3 + \\gamma V(S_3) \\big]$$\n",
    "#### $$V(S_1) = 0.5\\big[0 + 0.9 * -0.6 \\big] + 0.5 \\big[0 + 0.9 * 0.8 \\big]$$\n",
    "#### $$V(S_1) = 0.09$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.6 Example 6\n",
    "Now, in this example we are going to be looking at a simpler state diagram, but with more complex probabilities. This will be a somewhat more realistic scenario so we can picture what is happening. It will also allow us to separate _policy randomness_ from _state-arrival randomness_. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bellman-ex-6.png\" width=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The start state is that you are standing. At this point someone throws a ball at you (think dodgeball). You have two potential actions, you can either decide to \"jump\" or \"duck\". The next possible state is either you git hit, or you don't get hit (which means you are safe). We can say that the reward for getting hit is -1, and the reward for not getting hit is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we can see why these state diagrams are somewhat over simplistic. In particular, when looking at a tree like this, you may think that the action is to go to the next state. However, that does _not_ include all of the components of an MDP. We can see why that would not work in this scenario. We can't just choose \"don't get hit\", we can only choose to \"jump\" or \"duck\". This follows any real-life scenario. For example, we cannot choose to be rich. We can start a company and it may fail or it may succeed and make us rich, but can't _decide_ that. All we can do is take the action of starting the company. The state that we end up in (rich or not rich) is probabilistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, as we continue with our example, we can use the following probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action based on policy probabilities:**<br>\n",
    "#### $$\\pi(jump \\mid start) = 0.5$$\n",
    "#### $$\\pi(duck \\mid start) = 0.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**State transition probabilities:**<br>\n",
    "#### $$p(hit, reward=-1 \\mid jump, start) = 0.8$$\n",
    "#### $$p(hit, reward=0 \\mid jump, start) = 0$$\n",
    "#### $$p(safe, reward=-1 \\mid jump, start) = 0$$\n",
    "#### $$p(safe, reward=0 \\mid jump, start) = 0.2$$\n",
    "#### $$p(hit, reward=-1 \\mid duck, start) = 0.4$$\n",
    "#### $$p(hit, reward=0 \\mid duck, start) = 0$$\n",
    "#### $$p(safe, reward=-1 \\mid duck, start) = 0$$\n",
    "#### $$p(safe, reward=0 \\mid duck, start) = 0.6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we defined the distribution over the reward. We did not have to do this, however it shows what the entire probability space looks like. We can place in any other number for the reward and the probability is zero, as by the specifications for the problem (i.e. a reward of 10 would have 0% probability, because that does not exist in this game). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can of course just marginalize these in order to get rid of the reward completely since it is deterministic:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p(hit \\mid jump, start) = 0.8$$\n",
    "#### $$p(safe \\mid jump, start) = 0.2$$\n",
    "#### $$p(hit \\mid duck, start) = 0.4$$\n",
    "#### $$p(safe \\mid duck, start) = 0.6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can solve for the value of each state. As always, the value of the terminal states is 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(safe) = 0$$\n",
    "#### $$V(hit) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating $V(start)$ is the more challenging portion of this problem. We can start by writing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = \\sum_{a \\in \\{duck, jump\\}} \\pi(a \\mid start) \\sum_{s' \\in \\{safe, hit\\}} p(s' \\mid start, a) r(s, s')$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is still simpler than the full bellman equation, because we don't need to consider the value for the next state. In a situation like this it is nice to do a bit of a sanity check. When we see a summation inside of a another summation, we can think of at as a nested for loop. So, in the outer loop we have 2 things to sum over, and in the inner loop we have 2 things to sum over. We also know that the number times thing run in total is the size of the outer loop times the size of the inner loop. So, in total we should have 4 things to sum over. \n",
    "\n",
    "For brevity, we are going to stop showing the conditioning on the start state, since that is very clear, and we will abreviate jump with $j$ and duck with $d$. We end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = \\sum_{a \\in \\{d, j\\}} \\pi(a) \\sum_{s' \\in \\{safe, hit\\}} p(s' \\mid a) r(s, s')$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$V(start) = \\pi(j)p(safe \\mid j)*0 + \\pi(j)p(hit \\mid j)*-1 + \\pi(d)p(safe \\mid d)*0 + \\pi(d) p(hit \\mid d) * -1$$\n",
    "\n",
