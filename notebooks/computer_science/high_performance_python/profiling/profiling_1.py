"""
We will dig into profiling techniques by using the Julia Set:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set

We will calculate each pixel based on the Julia set. Each pixel is defined
with a location being a complex number, z, with a corresponding grey-scale
intensity:

----> f(z) = z^2 + c

So, in other words the intensity is the complex number z, squared, plus
a constant c.

        - The lists, x and y, are created entirely from scratch. Generally this could be accomplished
          with the range function, but the goal is for this to be as transparent as possible.
