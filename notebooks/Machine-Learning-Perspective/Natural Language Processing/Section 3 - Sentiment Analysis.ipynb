    "# Sentiment Analysis Overview\n",
    "* sentiment is a measure of how positive or negative something is\n",
    "* we are going to build a very simple sentiment analyzer \n",
    "* These are amazon reviews, so they come with 5 star ratings, and we are going to look at the electronics category \n",
    "* These are XML files, so we will need an XML parser \n",
    "\n",
    "# NLP Terminology\n",
    "* **Corpus**: Collection of text\n",
    "* **Tokens**: Words and punctuation that make up the corpus. \n",
    "* **Type**: a distinct token. Ex. \"Run, Lola Run\" has four tokens (comma counts as one) and 3 types.\n",
    "* **Vocabulary**: The set of all types. \n",
    "* The google corpus (collection of text) has 1 trillion tokens, and only 13 million types. English only has 1 million dictionary words, but the google corpus includes types such as \"www.facebook.com\". \n",
    "\n",
    "# Outline \n",
    "* we are just going to look at the electronics category \n",
    "* we could use the 5 star targets to do regression, but lets just do classification since they are already marked \"positive\" and \"negative\"\n",
    "* XML parser (going to use BeautifulSoup)\n",
    "* only look at **review_test**\n",
    "* To create our feature vector, we will count up the number of occurences of each word, and divided it by the total number of words  \n",
    "* For that to work we will need two passes through the data\n",
    "    1. One to collect the total number of distinct words, so that we know the size of our feature vector, in other words the vocabulary size, and possibly remove stop words like \"this\", \"is\", \"I\", \"to\", etc, to decrease the vocabulary size. The goal here is to know the index of each token\n",
    "    2. On the second pass, we will be able to assign values to each data vector which index corresponds to which words, and one to create data vectors \n",
    "* once we have that, it is simply a matter of creating a classifier like the one we did for our spam detector \n",
    "* so we will use logistic regression, so we can intepret the weights! \n",
    "* Ex: if you see a word like horrible and it has a weight of minus 1, it is associated with negative reviews"
