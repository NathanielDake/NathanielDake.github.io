    "One thing that turns out to be pretty useful when it comes to these transformations, it to measure exactly _how much_ it stretches or squishes things. More specifically, to measure the factor by which a given area increases or decreases:\n",

    "After the transformation, this turns into a 2x3 rectangle:\n",

    "\n",
    "Since this region started out with an area of 1, and ended up with an area of 6, we can say the linear transformation has _scaled its area_ by a factor of 6. Compare that to a shear whose matrix has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    1  & 1\\\\\n",
    "    0  & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the original area, contained by the square of the two unit vectors, is slanted; yet its area does not change: \n",

    "This brings up to a **key point**:\n",
    "> If you know how a single unit square's area changes, you can determine how the area of any possible region in space changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, whatever happens to one square in the grid, has to happen to any other square in the grid, no matter the size (this follows from the fact that grid lines must remain parallel and evenly spaced):\n",

    "## 1.1 Determinant Definition\n",
    "Now this very special scaling factor-the factor by which a linear transformation changes any area-is called the _**determinant**_ of a transformation. So, in the case of our earlier example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$det\\Big(\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    3  & 2\\\\\n",
    "    0  & 2\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\\Big) = 6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the _determinant_ of a transformation would be 3, if that transformation increases the area of a region by a factor of 3. It would be 1/2 if it squishes down all areas by a factor of 1/2. Finally, the determinant of a transformation is zero if it squishes all of space onto a line! Note, this will be relevant when we discuss eigenvectors. It means that checking if the determinant of a given matrix is zero will give a way of computing whether or not the transformation associated with that matrix squishes everything into a smaller dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should also quickly mention that a determinant can be _negative_. This means that space has been inverted (visually we can think of it as being flipped). A simple way to check if this has happened is to note that $\\hat{j}$ always starts to the left of $\\hat{i}$. If, after a transformation, $\\hat{i}$ is to the left of $\\hat{j}$ then we know orientation has changed. The absolute value of the determinant will still tell us the factor by which the area has been scaled. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may (reasonably) ask, why does this negative area relate to orientation flipping? That is most easily explained with a beautiful visual, seen [here](https://youtu.be/Ip3X9LOh2dk?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&t=306).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Determinant Computation\n",
    "You may still be wondering at this point, how we actually compute the determinant? While the actual computation is not nearly as important as the underlying meaning and what it represents, it is still useful to cover. We will define the computation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$det\\Big(\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    a  & b\\\\\n",
    "    c  & d\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\\Big) = ad - bc$$"
