    "# 1. Vectors\n",
    "In order to gain a deep and intuitive understanding of the mathematics behind ML, we must first ensure that we have a good grasp on what a vector is, from _all_ perspectives. One of the main sources of confusion surrounding vectors in ML is that the field is composed of those with backgrounds from mathematics, computer science, physics, and so on. Each one of these fields has its own intepretation and mental model of what a vector is-so we can start by reviewing each vantage point. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Physics Perspective\n",
    "From a physics perspective, a vector is an arrow pointing in space. What defines that vector is its length (magnitude) and the direction it is pointing in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/physics-vector.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors sitting in the flat plane are 2 dimensional, and those sitting in the space that humans live in are 3 dimensional. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Computer Science Perspective\n",
    "From the computer science perspective, vectors are ordered lists of numbers: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    2 \\\\\n",
    "    1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \n",
    "\\text{                }\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    5 \\\\\n",
    "    0 \\\\\n",
    "    0 \\\\\n",
    "    -3\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\text{                }\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    2.3 \\\\\n",
    "    -7.1 \\\\\n",
    "    0.1 \n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if we were performing some analytics concerning houses, we may be concerned with only 2 things regarding the house: _square footage_ and _price_. In that case you may model each house with a pair of numbers, the first indicating square footage, and the second indicating prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    \\text{square footage} \\\\\n",
    "    \\text{price}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \n",
    "=\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    2600 \\text{ ft}^2 \\\\\n",
    "    \\text{\\$300,000} \n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that order _does_ matter here. Now, in technical terms we are modeling houses as _2 dimensional vectors_. In this context, vector is essentially just a fancy word for list, and what makes it 2 dimensional is the fact that the length of the list is 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Mathematics Perspective\n",
    "The mathematician's goal is to _generalize_ both of these views. The result is defining a vector as anything where there is a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding Two Vectors:**<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-addition-1.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-addition-2.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-addition-3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiplying Vector By Number:**<br>\n",

    "<img src=\"images/vector-mult-2.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-mult-3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the details surrounding this view are rather abstract, and we will hold on discussing them for the time being, but it should be kept in mind that the main idea that this brings up is that multiplying and adding vectors plays an important role in linear algebra!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 For this notebook\n",
    "For the purposes of this notebook, when we refer to vectors we should first think of an arrow (vector) based at the origin (in linear algebra vectors are nearly always based a the origin, unlike the physics perspective), and we can then transfer this over to the list of numbers point of view. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Geometry \n",
    "Now if we look at how a vector is defined by a pair of numbers, we can think of that pair of numbers as a set of instructions for how to get from the _tail_ of the vector (at the origin) to the tip (the head). The first number tells us how far to walk along the x-axis, while the second number tells us how far to walk parallel to the y-axis, after walking along the x (positive numbers indicating upward motion, negative numbers indicating downward motion). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-geometry-1.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To distinguish vectors from points, the convention is to write this pair of numbers vertically with square brackets around them. This same idea can be applied to 3 dimensions, where the 3rd number tells us how far to move along the z axis:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.6 Vector Addition and Multiplication by Numbers\n",
    "Let's now get back to vector addition and multiplication by numbers; most topics in linear algebra are going to center around these 2 operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Addition**<br>\n",
    "We can define addition by moving the tail of the first vector, $\\vec{w}$, so that its tail sits at the tip of the first vector, $\\vec{v}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-addition-4.png\" width=\"250\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-addition-5.png\" width=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if you draw a new vector from the tail of the first vector to the tip of where the other sits, that new vector is their sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-addition-6.png\" width=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You may very well ask the question: \"Why this definition of addition and not some other one?\". Well, a way to think about it is that each vector represents a certain movement or step, with a certain distance and direction in space. When thinking about vector addition from a numerical perspective, we can think about a 4 step process: moving along the x-axis the amount instructed for the first vector, then the y-axis, and then repeating for the second vector, only now we are starting at the tip of the first vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-addition-7.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiplication by Scalars**<br>\n",
    "To define mutliplying a vector by a number, we can begin with thinking about taking a vector and stretching it or squishing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-multiplication-4.png\" width=\"250\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-multiplication-5.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number is a fraction the vector is squished, if it is negative the direction is reversed. This process is known as _scaling_. It is so common, that the numbers used to \"scale\" (2 in our example above) the vector are known as _**scalars**_. In fact, throughout linear algebra one of the main things we do is scale vectors, so it is very common to use the word scalar interchangebly with number. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerically this looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/vector-multiplication-6.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component of the vector is multiplied by the scalar. We will see going forward that linear algebra tends to revolve around vector addition and scalar multiplication. \n"
