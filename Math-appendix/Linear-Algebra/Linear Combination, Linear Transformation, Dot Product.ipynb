From PCA and it's utilization of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, to neural networks reliance on linear combinations and matrix multiplication, the list goes on and on. Having a very solid grasp on linear algebra is crucial to realizing _how_ and _why_ these algorithms work. \n",

    "# 2. Linear Transformations and Matrices\n",
    "Linear transformations are absolutely fundamental in order to understand matrix vector multiplication (well, unless you want to rely on memorization). To start, let's just parse the term \"Linear Transformation\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation is essentially just another way of saying _function_. This is where the first bit of confusion can arise though if you are being particularly thoughtful about the process's-what exactly is a function? It is helpful to define it before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function**<br>\n",
    "Generally, in mathematics we view a function as a process that take in an input and returns an output (this coincides nicely with the computer science view as well). It can be viewed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$x \\rightarrow f(x) \\rightarrow y$$\n",
    "Or, expanded as:\n",
    "#### $$x_1, x_2, ... , x_n \\rightarrow f(x_1, x_2, ... , x_n) \\rightarrow y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how it is _generally_ encountered, where anywhere from one to several inputs are taken in, and a single output is produced. However, let's define a function more rigorously:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A function is a _process_ or a relation that associates each element $x$ of a set $X$, the _domain_ of the function, to a single element $y$ of another set $Y$ (possibly the same set), the codomain of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important point to recognize from the above definition is that, while it is common for a function to map elements from a set $X$ to a different set $Y$, the two sets can be _same_. Hence, although it is not encountered quite as often in ML, a function can map $X \\rightarrow X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, back to our term transformation; it is something that takes in inputs, and spits out an output for each one. In the context of linear algebra, we like to think about transformations that take in some vector, and spit out another vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    2 \\\\\n",
    "    -3\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we can see an example of a function that does not map to a different space necessarily, but potentially to itself. In other words, generally if we have a function that takes in two inputs, we end up with one output:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$f(x,y) = z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can clearly see here that we take in two inputs (coordinates of the vector) and end up with two outputs (coordinates of the transformed vector). \n",
    "\n",
    "So, why use the word transformation instead of function if they essentially mean the same thing? Well, it is to be suggestive of _movement_! The way to think about functions of vectors is to use movement. If a transformation takes some input vector to some output vector, we image that input vector moving over to the output vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/linear-trans-1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And in order to think about the transformation as a whole, we can think about _every possible input vector_ moving over to its corresponding _output vector_. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point**<br>\n",
    "> We are now seeing that our general interpretation of a function can be expanded (via its full definition), to not simply taking in one or several inputs and producing a single output, but taking in one to several inputs, and producing one to several outputs. This expansion is key to recognizing the relationship between functions, linear transformations, and dot products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's pose the following question: If we were given the coordinates of a vector, and we then were trying to determine the coordinates of where that vector landed after being linearly transformed, how would we represent this?\n",

Dealing with non-square matrices and having an underlying intuition is crucial, especially when dealing with machine learning (specifically deep neural networks). More importantly, it should help bring our generalization around to include some of the functions we are more familiar with. \n",
