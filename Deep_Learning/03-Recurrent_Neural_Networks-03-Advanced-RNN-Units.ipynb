    "# 4. Advanced RNN Units\n",
    "We are now going to move into the realm of advanced RNN units. Up until this point, we have been dealing with the simple recurrent unit exclusively. However, implementing **Rated** units, **Gated Recurrent Units**, and **Long Short-Term Memory** will allow our models to become far more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Rated RNN Units\n",
    "A **rated recurrent unit** is simply a straightforward modification to the simple recurrent unit. Recall, a simple recurrent unit has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tGeRQ2PZsHbFq8XFsj32NC3gQ-46ilWZ\" width=\"320\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be observed on a lower level as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1F0wDzeyGBAa1l4_mDrIAiejherkAkb8p\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And mathematically, we can define $h(t)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = f\\big(W_x^T x(t) + W_h^T h(t-1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f$ is our chosen activation function. The idea is that we we want to weight two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $f\\big(x(t), h(t-1)\\big)$, which is the output that we would have gotten in a simple recurrent unit.\n",
    "2. $h(t-1)$, the previous value of the hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this weighting, we use a matrix known as the **rate matrix**, $z$, which is the same size as the hidden layer. We then perform an element by element multiplication on each dimension:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = (1-z) \\odot h(t-1) + z \\odot f\\big( x(t), h(t-1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$z$ is known as the rate. You may notice that this looks very similar to the low pass filter that we created in the previous post. The idea here to is to learn $z$ in a way that it let's the some values from previous points in time carry greater weight, and others depend mainly on the most recent values. Visually, the rated recurrent unit looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Tx7TAd3tUV-7-ezVPbJztx8dZyA3yC7m\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes needed to implement this in code are relatively small and straightforward. We simply need to add a new param of size $M$, and include the above equation in the `recurrence` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Rate Matrix Modifications\n",
    "There are more options for the rate matrix than simply what was discussed above. For example, we can make it dependent on the input and previous hidden state via a sigmoid and more weight matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make it a matrix (size $M x M$) so that it multiplies against $h$ with matrix multiplication, instead of element wise multiplication. In this case, you can picture what is happening as the same type of everything connected to everything scenario that we had for the hidden to hidden state. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Modifications to Poetry Generation\n",
    "The next thing that we are going to do is redo our poem generation example with the rated recurrent unit. It will be clear that this is just a small modification from the simple recurrent unit, so the code is almost exactly the same. Note, this new parameter will be trained in exactly the same way as all the other parameters-via gradient descent. In fact, when we look at more complex models the training will still remiain the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add a bit more complexity to the mix, we are going to try and solve the problem of the lines ending too quickly. Recall that this is because we have many training samples that result in the next word being the end token. Because the end token shows up in every line, it is over represented in the training data. To prevent this, we will only train for going to the end of the sequence 10% of the time. Otherwise we stop on the second to last word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another change that we will make is that we will not model the initial distribution anymore. Recall, we use this to prevent every line from starting with the same word. This would happen because neural networks will give us the same prediction every time if we use the argmax. Instead, we will use the `START` token as the input, and the output will represent a probability distribution. This is valid because we already know that softmax gives us a valid probability distribution. We can then sample from this distribution to generate the next word. This way the sequences that we generate will be more stochastic, and it will treat the output probability as an actual probability, rather than a deterministic prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p(w0) = softmax(f(START))\n",
    "w0 = randint(V, p=p(w0))\n",

I have chosen to start with GRU's because they are slightly less complex, and thus a better place to begin.

The result here is that we get a mixture of both.\n",

It controls how much of the previous hidden state we will consider, when we create the new candidate hidden value. In other words, it has the ability to reset the hidden value. \n",

    "For instance, consider the situation where $r_t$ is equal to 0, then we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, if that all sounds a bit complex, there is a practical way to reason with it. At the most general level, we are simply adding more parameters to our model, and making it more expressive. Adding more parameters allows us to fit more complex patterns. \n",

    "### 2.2 GRU in Code\n",
    "When it comes to implement a GRU in code, it should be relatively simple if you already understand the simple recurrent unit and the rated recurrent unit. We simply need to add more weights, and modify the recurrence. The next step to making our code better is to modularize it. We have mentioned that the GRU can be looked at as a black box. To do this, we can simply make the GRU into a class so that it can be abstracted away. By doing this, we can stack GRU's, meaning anywhere that a hidden layer could go, a GRU can go as well. This allows us to just think of it as a thing that takes an input and produces an output. The fact that it contains a memory of previous inputs is just an internal detail of the black box. \n",

LSTM stands for **Long Short-Term Memory**, and it is a type of recurrent unit that has become very popular in recent years due to its superior performance/ability to overcome the vanishing gradient problem. Each recurrent unit that we have dug into has gotten progressively more complex, and each incorporated concepts from the previous unit. \n",

However, that complexity does not involve abstract ideas or new mathematics; rather, the number of components that we are dealing with is higher.

Additionally, we are going to add yet another internal unit that will exist alongside the hidden state, sometimes referred to as a **memory cell**. One way to think of this cell is that it takes the place of $\\hat{h}$, or the candidate hidden value, when we talked about the GRU.\n",

    "A few things to note about the above function:\n",
    "* Because the number of files that we are working with is too large to fit into memory, we must limit the amount of data that is loaded at a single time\n",
    "* We must also limit the vocabulary size, the 2000 most common words is appropriate\n",
    "* To do this, we must keep a count of how many times a word has appeared in the dictionary. Next, we need to sort that dictionary by value, in reverse so that the highest count value comes first. This will give us the index's for the top 2000 words. However, we are still not done. Our word embedding matrix needs to be of size $V = 2000$, so the word index's must be from 0-2000. But the word index's we currently have are just 2000 random numbers from 0-1,000,000. Hence, we need to create a new word mapping from old index to new index, where the old word index is any number from 0 to 1 million, and the new word index is a number from 0 to 2000. This also means we need to create a new word2idx dictionary as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.4 Training on the entire dataset\n",
    "Now, I should now that if we train on the entire dataset there is a good chance that we will run out of memory. To prevent this, we don't want to load all of our data into memory at the same time. One strategy would be to train on each separate text file, opening each within each epoch. We would have to, of course, keep a dictionary of the word2idx mapping handy, so that it remains consistent between each file. This would be rather slow of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option, would be to convert each sentence into a list of word index's before running the neural network, and then save the word2idx mapping to a file as well. That way our input data can be just a bunch of arrays of word index's. This would still need to be in multiple files since it would still take up too much RAM, but we would prevent needing to convert the data each time we open the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "A final option would to use a DB like MySQL in order to store the arrays of word indexes. This way we could retrieve rows at random, without needing to store them in memory. \n",
