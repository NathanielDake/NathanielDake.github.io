    "# 4. Advanced RNN Units\n",
    "We are now going to move into the realm of advanced RNN units. Up until this point, we have been dealing with the simple recurrent unit exclusively. However, implementing **Rated** units, **Gated Recurrent Units**, and **Long Short-Term Memory** will allow our models to become far more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Rated RNN Units\n",
    "A **rated recurrent unit** is simply a straightforward modification to the simple recurrent unit. Recall, a simple recurrent unit has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tGeRQ2PZsHbFq8XFsj32NC3gQ-46ilWZ\" width=\"320\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be observed on a lower level as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1F0wDzeyGBAa1l4_mDrIAiejherkAkb8p\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And mathematically, we can define $h(t)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = f\\big(W_x^T x(t) + W_h^T h(t-1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f$ is our chosen activation function. The idea is that we we want to weight two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $f\\big(x(t), h(t-1)\\big)$, which is the output that we would have gotten in a simple recurrent unit.\n",
    "2. $h(t-1)$, the previous value of the hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this weighting, we use a matrix known as the **rate matrix**, $z$, which is the same size as the hidden layer. We then perform an element by element multiplication on each dimension:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = (1-z) \\odot h(t-1) + z \\odot f\\big( x(t), h(t-1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$z$ is known as the rate. You may notice that this looks very similar to the low pass filter that we created in the previous post. The idea here to is to learn $z$ in a way that it let's the some values from previous points in time carry greater weight, and others depend mainly on the most recent values. Visually, the rated recurrent unit looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Tx7TAd3tUV-7-ezVPbJztx8dZyA3yC7m\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes needed to implement this in code are relatively small and straightforward. We simply need to add a new param of size $M$, and include the above equation in the `recurrence` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Rate Matrix Modifications\n",
    "There are more options for the rate matrix than simply what was discussed above. For example, we can make it dependent on the input and previous hidden state via a sigmoid and more weight matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make it a matrix (size $M x M$) so that it multiplies against $h$ with matrix multiplication, instead of element wise multiplication. In this case, you can picture what is happening as the same type of everything connected to everything scenario that we had for the hidden to hidden state. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Modifications to Poetry Generation\n",
    "The next thing that we are going to do is redo our poem generation example with the rated recurrent unit. It will be clear that this is just a small modification from the simple recurrent unit, so the code is almost exactly the same. Note, this new parameter will be trained in exactly the same way as all the other parameters-via gradient descent. In fact, when we look at more complex models the training will still remiain the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add a bit more complexity to the mix, we are going to try and solve the problem of the lines ending too quickly. Recall that this is because we have many training samples that result in the next word being the end token. Because the end token shows up in every line, it is over represented in the training data. To prevent this, we will only train for going to the end of the sequence 10% of the time. Otherwise we stop on the second to last word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another change that we will make is that we will not model the initial distribution anymore. Recall, we use this to prevent every line from starting with the same word. This would happen because neural networks will give us the same prediction every time if we use the argmax. Instead, we will use the `START` token as the input, and the output will represent a probability distribution. This is valid because we already know that softmax gives us a valid probability distribution. We can then sample from this distribution to generate the next word. This way the sequences that we generate will be more stochastic, and it will treat the output probability as an actual probability, rather than a deterministic prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p(w0) = softmax(f(START))\n",
    "w0 = randint(V, p=p(w0))\n",

I have chosen to start with GRU's because they are slightly less complex, and thus a better place to begin.

The result here is that we get a mixture of both.\n",

    "The new component is $r_t$, or the **reset gate**, which has the exact same functional form as the update gate- all of its weights are the same size. However, it is position in the black box is different. The reset gate is multiplied by the previous hidden state value. It controls how much of the previous hidden state we will consider, when we create the new candidate hidden value. In other words, it has the ability to reset the hidden value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the situation where $r_t$ is equal to 0, then we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{h}_t = g \\big(x_t W_{xh} + b_h\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be as if $x_t$ were the beginning of a new sequence. Note that this is not the full picture, since $\\hat{h}$ is only a candidate for the new $h_t$, since $h_t$ will be a combination of $\\hat{h}$ and $h_{t-1}$ (which is controlled by the updated gate $z_t$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if that all sounds a bit complex, there is a practical way to reason with it. At the most general level, we are simply adding more parameters to our model, and making it more expressive. Adding more parameters allows us to fit more complex patterns. \n",

    "### 2.2 GRU in Code\n",
    "When it comes to implement a GRU in code, it should be relatively simple if you already understand the simple recurrent unit and the rated recurrent unit. We simply need to add more weights, and modify the recurrence. The next step to making our code better is to modularize it. We have mentioned that the GRU can be looked at as a black box. To do this, we can simply make the GRU into a class so that it can be abstracted away. By doing this, we can stack GRU's, meaning anywhere that a hidden layer could go, a GRU can go as well. This allows us to just think of it as a thing that takes an input and produces an output. The fact that it contains a memory of previous inputs is just an internal detail of the black box. \n",

    "We are now going to move on from the GRU and start working with the **LSTM**. LSTM stands for **Long Short-Term Memory**, and it is a type of recurrent unit that has become very popular in recent years due to its superior performance/ability to overcome the vanishing gradient problem. Each recurrent unit that we have dug into has gotten progressively more complex, and each incorporated concepts from the previous unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM is the most complex recurrent unit we will cover. However, that complexity does not involve abstract ideas or new mathematics; rather, the number of components that we are dealing with is higher. Essentially, we will now have **three different gates**, called the **input**, **output**, and **forget** gate. Additionally, we are going to add yet another internal unit that will exist alongside the hidden state, sometimes referred to as a **memory cell**. One way to think of this cell is that it takes the place of $\\hat{h}$, or the candidate hidden value, when we talked about the GRU.\n",
