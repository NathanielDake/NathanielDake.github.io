    "# 1. Probability of a Sequence\n",
    "We have gone over the equations utilized in determining the probability of a sequence, but we will now solidify that with an actual example. Here is the problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a magician who has two biased coins, _coin 1_ and _coin 2_ that he is flipping. We are trying to determine the probability of observing the following sequence of coin flips:<br>\n",

    "$$p\\big(HHT \\big)$$<br>\n",
    "$$p\\big( x(1)=H, x(2)=H, x(3)=T \\big)$$<br>\n",
    "To start, we know that since the magician has two coins, the number of hidden states, $M$, is 2. We also know that we can either observe a flipped coin being heads or tails, so the number of possible observed symbols is also 2. We are told that the magician really likes coin 1, so the initial state distribution is:<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/initial-1.png\" width=\"150\">\n",

    "He is also very figity, and tends to switch between coins very often, so his state transition matrix is:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/state-transition-1.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Finally, the coin 1 is biased towards heads and has a 0.7 probability of being heads, and a 0.3 probability of being tails. Coin 2 is biased towards tails, and has a 0.6 probability of being tails, and a 0.4 probability of being heads. Hence, the observation matrix looks like:<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/observation-1.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have all of the information needed to find the probability of the sequence $H,H,T$. Intuitively, we can think about it as follows: We must first take into account the probability that we start in specific state, and from that state we observed heads. We then must account for the probability that from that state we transition to another hidden state and observe heads. And finally, we must take into the account that from the second hidden state we transition to _another_ hidden state and observe tails. Let's look at each part separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 The probability of the Initial State\n",
    "We can write the probability of the initial state and observing heads as:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$p\\big(x(2)=1|z(2)\\big) = B\\big(z(2),x(2)=1\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we repeated this process for transitioning from state 2 to 3, we would end up with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p\\big(x,z \\big) = \\pi\\big(z(1)\\big)p\\big(x(1)=1|z(1)\\big) * p\\big(z(2)|z(1)\\big) * p\\big(x(2)=1|z(2)\\big) * p\\big(z(3)|z(2)\\big) * p\\big(x(3)=0|z(3)\\big)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, at this point we can see that there are multiple values that $z$ can take on, and that in order to find $p(x)$ we must marginalize out $z$, like so:\n",

    "#### 2.1.3 Step 2 $\\rightarrow$ The Induction Step\n",
    "At that point, we come to the _induction step_. We are trying to find $p\\big(x(1), x(2)\\big)$ now. We know that the induction step is an updating of $\\alpha$ defined as:\n",

With that said, inuitively we can think of the induction step as follows (in relation to our magician example): At $t=1$ the magician in holding one of the coins-we are not sure which-and we observe him flip a heads. We then go to $t=2$, he shuffles the coins behind his back, and then flips one of the coins where we again observe a heads. What we want to know is, what is the probability of that happening?\n",

    "In order to determine that we must consider that the magician could transition from coin 1 or 2 at $t=1$, to coin 1 or 2 at $t=2$, where we then must determine the probability of observing $x(2)=heads$. This can be written as:\n",

    "# 3.3 Viterbi Algorithm\n",
    "So far, the question that we have been asking is: _Given a sequence of observed symbols, what is the sequence's probability?_ Another question that we are likely to want to ask is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is the sequence of hidden states, given the observation?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the _**Viterbi Algorithm**_ comes in; it calculates the most probable hidden states sequence, given the observed sequence, under the current model. Now, we will be sure to highlight that the viterbi algorithm works in a very similar manner to the forward algorithm. Whereas in the Forward Algorithm for each induction step we would take the sum of the current row of $\\alpha$ (in effect marginalizing over all states of $z$), we are now going to take the _max_ of the row. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will create two new variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta(t,i) = max \\Big \\{p\\big(z(1), z(t)=i, x(1),...,x(t) \\big) \\Big \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi(t,i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\delta(t,i)$, is indexed by time and state. This will represent the maximum probability of ending up in state $i$ at time $t$, which is a joint probability distribution over the state sequence and observed sequence.\n",
    "* $\\psi(t,i)$, which is also indexed by time and state. This will keep track of the actual state sequences that end up at time $t$ and in state $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Step 1 $\\rightarrow$ Initialization\n",
    "As with the forward algorithm, the first step that we will take is to find the initial values of our new variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta(t,i) = \\pi_i B\\big(i, x(1)\\big)$$\n",
    "$$\\psi(1,i) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the initialization of $\\delta$ is identical to that of $\\alpha$. In our magician example, we would again have $M=2$ states, so we need to find $\\delta(1, i = 1)$ and $\\delta(1, i = 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta(1,i=1) = \\pi_1 B\\big(1, x(1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta(1,i=2) = \\pi_2 B\\big(2, x(1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi(1,i = 1) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi(1,i = 2) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually this can be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/viterbi-example-1.png\" width=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that there are two paths that can be followed (in yellow and purple). The first represents the probability of starting with coin 1 and then observing heads ($\\delta(1,i=1)$), while the second represents the probability of starting with coin 2 and observing heads ($\\delta(1,i=2)$). Note that we do not need to take the maximum since there is only one potential option for each state $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.2 Step 2 $\\rightarrow$ Recursively Update\n",
    "We now have the _recursion_ step where we update our variables for all times and states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta(t, j) = max_{1 \\leq i \\leq M} \\big \\{ \\delta(t-1, i) A(i,j)\\big \\} B\\big(j, x(t) \\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi(t,j) = argmax_{1 \\leq i \\leq M} \\big \\{ \\delta(t-1, i) A(i,j)\\big \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we would first consider time step $t=2$. Visually, we can see the scenario below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/viterbi-example-2.png\" width=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that for $z(2) = 1$, in other words for the second time step when the state is coin 1, there are _two ways we can get there_. We can come from the coin 1 ($\\delta(1,1)$), or from coin 2 ($\\delta(1,2)$). These paths are represented by the yellow arrows. The goal of this step is to determine which incoming path (yellow arrow) has a higher probability. In order to determine that we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take into account the probability of being at the origin of each yellow arrow. Mathematically, that means taking into account $\\delta(1,1)$ and $\\delta(1,2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take into account the probability of transitioning from the state $i$, to the state $j$. Mathematically, we will use the transition matrix, $A(i,j)$, for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can state our goal as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For each state in the current time step, find the incoming state, $i$, that maximizes $\\delta(t-1, i) A(i,j)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can go through this for $t=2$ and state $j = 1$. In order to find $\\delta(2,1)$, we can perform the following calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta(2,1) = max \\Big \\{ \\big(\\delta(1, 1) A(1,1)\\big), \\big(\\delta(1, 2) A(2,1)\\big) \\Big \\} B \\big(1, x(2) = heads\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And in order to find $\\psi(t, j)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi(2, 1) = argmax_i \\Big \\{ \\big(\\delta(1, i=1) A(i=1,1)\\big), \\big(\\delta(1, i=2) A(i=2,1)\\big) \\Big \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to intuitively think of $\\psi$ is as follows. Let's say for a second that we have $\\psi(t=2, j =1)$ and $\\psi(t=2, j =2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\psi(t=2, j =1)$ is representing the coin that was most likely transitioned _from_ in order to get to coin 1.\n",
    "* $\\psi(t=2, j =2)$ is representing the coin that was most likely transitioned _from_ in order to get to coin 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.3 Step 3 $\\rightarrow$ Termination Step\n",
    "For the best state sequence, in the final best state, we can perform the following calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z(T)^* = argmax_{1 \\leq i \\leq M} \\delta(T, i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the rest of the best state sequence, we just need to back track using $\\psi$. This is done for time equals $T-1$ all the way down to 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z(t)^* = \\psi (t+1, z(t+1)^*)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this is that we know that taking the argmax over our $\\delta$ with respect to $i$ will give us the final state. Once we know that, recall that our variable $\\psi$ is designed to keep track of what coin we most likely came from in order to get the current one. In other words, once we know our last state (by taking the argmax of $\\delta$), we can use $\\psi$ in order to find what coin we most likely transitioned from to get there. That will be our coin for the previous time step, at which point we can use $\\psi$ again! This is what is meant by _back tracking_.  "
