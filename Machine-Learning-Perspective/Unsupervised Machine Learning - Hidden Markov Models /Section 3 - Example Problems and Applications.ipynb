    "# 1. Sick or Healthy\n",
    "We will now look at a model that examines our state of healthiness vs. being sick. Keep in mind that this is very much like something you could do in real life. If you wanted to model a certain situation or environment, we could take some data that we have gathered, build a maximum likelihood model on it, and do things like study the properties that emerge from the model, or make predictions from the model, or generate the next most likely state. \n",

    "# 3. SEO and Bounce Rate Optimization \n",
    "We are now going to look at SEO and Bounch Rate Optimization. This is a problem that every developer and website owner can relate to. You have a website and obviously you would like to increase traffic, increase conversions, and avoid a high bounce rate (which could lead to google assigning your page a low ranking). What would a good way of modeling this data be? Without even looking at any code we can look at some examples of things that we want to know, and how they relate to markov models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Arrival\n",
    "First and foremost, how do people arrive on your page? Is it your home page? Your landing page? Well, this is just the very first page of what is hopefully a sequence of pages. So, the markov analogy here is that this is just the initial state distribution or $\\pi$. So, once we have our markov model, the $\\pi$ vector will tell us which of our pages a user is most likely to start on. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Sequences of Pages \n",
    "What about sequences of pages? Well, if you think people are getting to your landing page, hitting the buy button, checking out, and then closing the browser window, you can test the validity of that assumption by calculating the probability of that sequence. Of course, the probability of any sequence is probability going to be much less than 1. This is because for a longer sequence, we have more multiplication, and hence smaller final numbers. We do have two alternatives however:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * 1) You can compare the probability of two different sequences. So, are people going through the entire checkout process? Or is it more probable that they are just bouncing? \n",
    "* 2) Another option is to just find the transition probabilities themselves. These are conditional probabilities instead of joint probabilities. You want to know, once they have made it to the landing page, what is the probability of hitting buy. Then, once they have hit buy, what is the probability of them completing the checkout. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Bounce Rate\n",
    "This is hard to measure, unless you are google and hence have analytics on nearly every page on the web. This is because once a user has left your site, you can no longer run code on their computer or track what they are doing. However, let's pretend that we can determine this information. Once we have done this, we can measure which page has the highest bounce rate. At this point we can manually analyze that page and ask our marketing people \"what is different about this page that people don't find it useful/want to leave?\" We can then address that problem, and the hopefully later analysis shows that the fixed page no longer has a high bounce right. In the markov model, we can just represents this as the null state. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Data\n",
    "So, the data we are going to be working with has two columns: `last_page_id` and `next_page_id`. This can be interpreted as the current page and the next page. The site has 10 pages with the id's 0-9. We can represent start pages by making the current page -1, and the next page the actual page. We can represent the end of the page with two different codes, `B`(bounce) or `C` (close). In the case of bounce, the user saw the page and then immediately bounced. In the case of close, the user saw the page stayed and potentially saw some useful information, and then closed the window. So, you can imagine that our engineer may use time as a factor in determining if it is a bounce or a close.  "
