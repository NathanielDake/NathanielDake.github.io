    "This post was inspired and based off of chapter fourteen of the book _Beautiful Data_, the chapter being written by Peter Norvig. The chapter can be found <a href=\"http://norvig.com/ngrams/ch14.pdf\">here</a>. The exercise will examining data consisting of the plainest of speech: 1 trillion words of English, taken from publically available webpages. \n",

    "This data set was published by Thorsten Brants and Alex Franz of Google in 2006, and is made publically available through the Linguistic Data Consortium <a href=\"https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T13\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set summarizes the original texts by _counting_ the number of appearances of each words, and of each two-, three-, four-, and five-word sequence. For example, the word \"the\" appears 23 billion times (2.2% of the trillion words), making it the most common word. \n",

    "# 1. Word Segmentation\n",
    "In general, English readers do not need to perform the task of _word segmentation_, the process of deciding where word boundaries are. This is directly due to the use of spaces in the english language (as contrasted with, for example, Mandarin). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some texts, such as URL's, spaces are not present. How could a search engine or computer program work out such a mistake? \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, lets look at the English text \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"**choosespain.com**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This website is hoping to convince you to choose Spain as a travel destination, but if you segment the name wrong, you get the less appealing name:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"chooses pain\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a human reader, you are able to make the right choice by drawing upon years of experience; you may initially guess that it would be nearly an insurmountable task to encode that experience into a computer algorithm. However, there is a shortcut we can take that works surprisingly well! We can look up each phrase in the bigram table! We see that \"choose Spain\" has a count of 3,210, whereas \"chooses pain\" does not appear at all (which means that it occurs fewer than 40 times in the trillion word corpus). Thus \"choose Spain\" is at least 80 times more likely, and can safely be consdered the right segmentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now supposed we are trying to interpret the phrase:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **insufficientnumbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add together capitalized and lowercase version of the words, the counts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `insufficient numbers ->  20715` <br>\n",
    "  `in sufficient numbers -> 32378`\n",
    "  \n",
    "“In sufficient numbers” is 50% more frequent than “insufficient numbers” but that’s\n",
    "hardly compelling evidence. We are left in a frustrating position: we can guess, but we\n",
    "can’t be confident. In uncertain problems like this, we don’t have any way of calculating a definitive correct answer, we don’t have a complete model of what makes one answer\n",
    "right, and in fact human experts don’t have a complete model, either, and can disagree on\n",
    "the answer. Still, there is an established methodology for solving uncertain problems. "

    "## 1.1 Methodology \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Define a probabilistic model\n",
    "While we can't define all the factors (semantic, syntactic, lexical, social) that make \"choose Spain\" a better candidate for a domain name, but we can define a simplified model that gives approximate probabilities. For short candidates like \"choose Spain\" we could just look up the _n_-gram in the corpus data and use that as the probability. For longer candidates we will need some way of composing an answer from smaller parts. For words we haven't seen before, we'll have to estimate the probability of an unknown word. The point is that we define a _language model_- a probability distribution over all the strings in the language-and learn the parameters of the model from our corpus data, then use the model to define the probability of each candidate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Enumerate the candidates\n",
    "We may not be sure whether “insufficient numbers” or “in\n",
    "sufficient numbers” is more likely to be the intended phrase, but we can agree that\n",
    "they are both candidate segmentations, as is “in suffi cient numb ers,” but that “hello world” is not a valid candidate. In this step we withhold judgment and just enumerate\n",
    "possibilities—all the possibilities if we can, or else a carefully selected sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Choose the most probable candidate\n",
    "Apply the language model to each candidate to get its probability, and choose the one with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a mathematical perspective this can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$best = argmax_{c \\in candidates} P(c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And from a code perspective, it would be:\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "```\n",
    "best = max(candidates, key=P)\n",
    "```\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now apply this methodology to segmentation. We want to define a function, `segment`, which takes as input a string with no spaces and returns a list of words that is the best segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> segment('choosespain')\n",
    "['choose','spain']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with step 1, the probabilistic language model. The probability of a sequence of words is the product of the probabilities of each word, given the words context: all the preceeding words. It can be written mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$P(W_{1:n}) = \\prod_{k=1:n}P(W_k \\;|\\;W_{1:k-1} )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if we were analyzing the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The dog ran\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be broken down into:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$P(\"the \\; dog \\; ran\") = P(the) * P(dog \\; | \\; the) * P(ran \\; | \\; the dog)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we don’t have the data to compute this exactly, so we can approximate the equation by\n",
    "using a smaller context. Since we have data for sequences up to 5-grams, it would be\n",
    "tempting to use the 5-grams, so that the probability of an n-word sequence would be the\n",
    "product of each word given the four previous words (not all previous words).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three difficulties with the 5-gram model. First, the 5-gram data is about 30\n",
    "gigabytes, so it can’t all fit in RAM. Second, many 5-gram counts will be 0, and we’d need\n",
    "some strategy for backing off, using shorter sequences to estimate the 5-gram probabilities. Third, the search space of candidates will be large because dependencies extend up to four words away. All three of these difficulties can be managed, with some effort. But instead, let’s first consider a much simpler language model that solves all three difficulties at once: a **unigram model**, in which the probability of a sequence is just the product of the probability of each word by itself. In this model, the probability of each word is independent of the other words (this is a naive bayes approach of a bayesian network):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$P(W_{1:n}) \\prod_{k=1:n}P(W_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we were to segment `wheninrome`, we would consider candidates such as `when` `in` `rome`, and compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$P(when) * P(in) * P(rome)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the product is higher than any other candidates product, then that is the best answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "An _n_-character string has $2^{n-1}$ different segmentations (there are _n_-1 positions between characters, each of which can either be or not be a word boundary. Thus the string:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `wheninthecourseofhumaneventsitbecomesnecessary` \n",
    "\n",
    "has 35 trillion segmentations. But you most definitely were able to find the right segmentation in just a few seconds; clearly, you couldn't have enumerated all the candidates. You most likely scanned \"w\", \"wh\", and \"whe\", and rejected them as improbable words, but accepted \"when\" as probable. Then you moved on to the remainder and found its best segmentation. Once we make the simplifying assumption that each word is independent of the others, it means that we don’t have to consider all combinations of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "That gives us a sketch of the `segment` function: consider every possible way to split the text into a first word and a remaining text (we can arbitrarily limit the longest possible word to, say, L=20 letters). For each possible split, find the best way to segment the remainder. Out of all the possible candidates, the one with the highest product of P(first)× P(remaining) is the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show a table of choices for the first word, probability of the word, probability of the best segmentation of the remaining words, and probability of the whole (which is the product of the probabilities of the first and the remainder). We see that the segmentation starting with “when” is 50,000 times better than the second-best candidate.\n",
