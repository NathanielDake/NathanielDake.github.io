    "# Continuous Random Variables and Probability Density Functions\n",
    "* Quantities whose values range over an interval of numbers are called continuous random variables, denoted, $x$\n",
    "* Associated with $X$ is a **probability density function** (abbreviated **pdf**), $f(x)$, so that:\n",
    "$$p(a \\leq x \\leq b) = \\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$$\n",
    "Basically, you are trying to calculate that a random variable $x$ is between two particular values. To do this, you integrate over the probability density function, and those values turn into your limits of integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that a probability must always be greater than or equal to zero. So our pdf must satisfy this restriction:\n",
    "$$f(x) \\geq 0 \\;\\forall x$$\n",
    "saying that for any x value, the pdf *has to be greater than zero*. It must also satisfy the following:\n",
    "$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)dx = 1$$\n",
    "Which calculates the total probability, it must add up to 1, or 100%. \n",
    "\n",
    "### You can often prove that a function is a probability density function if it satisfies those two requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Waiting time at call center\n",
    "Suppose you call into a call center, and your average waiting time for your call to be answered is 6 minutes. Associated with your waiting time is a probability density function! We will use $f(t)$ since it associated with time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what $f(t)$ looks like:\n",
    "$$f(t) = \\begin{cases} 0 \\; if\\; t < 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{6}e^{\\frac{-t}{6}} \\; if\\; t \\geq 0 \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "So here is the question: Given what we know about the pdf, what is the probability that your call is answered within the first 2 minutes?\n",
    "\n",
    "So we are trying to find:\n",
    "$$P(0\\leq X \\leq 2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means what we are trying to solve is:\n",
    "$$\\int_{0}^{2}\\frac{1}{6}e^{\\frac{-t}{6}}dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets not go through and solve this now, but solving it would give an answer of 28.35%. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Binomial Distribution\n",
    "This is a discrete probability distribution. Background required- must know the combinations formula!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combinations Formula \n",
    "Lets say that we have 6 people: \n",
    "$$A,B,C,D,E,F$$\n",
    "and we have 4 chairs:\n",
    "$$1,2,3,4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How many different ways can we fit these people into these 4 chairs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well it looks like this: When we have someone sit in the first chair, there are 6 people so 6 possibilities. When we then have someone sit in the second chair, there are only 5 possibilities since someone had already sat in the first chair. When we fill in the 3rd chair we only have 4 possible people left to fill it, and only 3 people left by the time we reach the 4th chair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically that looks like:\n",
    "$$6*5*4*3$$\n",
    "And it represents the number of permutations!\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Combination:** when the order does not matter\n",
    "**Permutation:** when the order does mater \n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we wanted to write the above equation in terms of factorial, we could write it as:\n",
    "$$\\frac{6!}{(6-4)!} = \\frac{6*5*4*3*2*1}{2!} = 360$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of the permutations formula. This basically says if I am taking $n$ things and putting them into $k$ spots, the number of permutations looks like:\n",
    "$$_nP_k = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we go into the world of combinations. In permutations, a distinction was made between who was sitting in what chair. In other worlds, when it comes to permutations:\n",
    "$$ABCD$$\n",
    "is different than\n",
    "$$DABC$$\n",
    "However, in combinations, those would be the same combination! Mathematically that looks like (**combinations formula**):\n",
    "$$_nC_k = \\frac{\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{k!}= \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\begin{pmatrix}n \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "where the k! represents the number of ways to arrange k things in k spots!\n",
    "\n",
    "So in relation to our example above, we saw there were 360 ways of seating 6 people into 4 chairs. But what if we didn't care about order? What if we just cared about how many different ways there were to choose 4 people from a pool of 6? That would be:\n",
    "$$_6C_4 = \\begin{pmatrix}6 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = 15$$\n",
    "So there are only 15 different combinations compared to 360 permutations!"

    "This is a discrete probability distribution. For example, say we toss a fair coin once. What is the distribution of the number of heads? \n",

    "Let X = 1 if a success occurs, and X = 0 if a failure occurs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case X will have a **Bernoulli distribution**: \n",

    "\n",
    "Well lets think about this for a second. We have a **single trial**, each person is a lawyer or they are not, and the conditions of the Bernoulli distribution are satisfied! So we will end up with a Bernoulli distribution with p =1/200. If we let the random variable $X$ represent the number of lawyers in our sample size 1, then the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on the value $x$ is:\n",
    "$$P(X =x)=(\\frac{1}{200})^x(1-\\frac{1}{200})^{1-x}$$\n",
