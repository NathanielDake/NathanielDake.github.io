    "# 1. Probability of a Sequence\n",
    "We have gone over the equations utilized in determining the probability of a sequence, but we will now solidify that with an actual example. Here is the problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a magician who has two biased coins, _coin 1_ and _coin 2_ that he is flipping. We are trying to determine the probability of observing the following sequence of coin flips:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$p\\big(HHT \\big)$$<br>\n",
    "$$p\\big( x(1)=H, x(2)=H, x(3)=T \\big)$$<br>\n",
    "To start, we know that since the magician has two coins, the number of hidden states, $M$, is 2. We also know that we can either observe a flipped coin being heads or tails, so the number of possible observed symbols is also 2. We are told that the magician really likes coin 1, so the initial state distribution is:<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/initial-1.png\" width=\"150\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "He is also very figity, and tends to switch between coins very often, so his state transition matrix is:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/state-transition-1.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Finally, the coin 1 is biased towards heads and has a 0.7 probability of being heads, and a 0.3 probability of being tails. Coin 2 is biased towards tails, and has a 0.6 probability of being tails, and a 0.4 probability of being heads. Hence, the observation matrix looks like:<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/observation-1.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have all of the information needed to find the probability of the sequence $H,H,T$. Intuitively, we can think about it as follows: We must first take into account the probability that we start in specific state, and from that state we observed heads. We then must account for the probability that from that state we transition to another hidden state and observe heads. And finally, we must take into the account that from the second hidden state we transition to _another_ hidden state and observe tails. Let's look at each part separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The probability of the Initial State\n",
    "We can write the probability of the initial state and observing heads as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$\\pi\\big(z(1)\\big)p\\big(x(1)=1|z(1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The probability of transitioning from state 1 to state 2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p\\big(z(2)|z(1)\\big) = A\\big(z(1),z(2)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 The probability of observing heads from state 2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p\\big(x(2)=1|z(2)\\big) = B\\big(z(2),x(2)=1\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we repeated this process for transitioning from state 2 to 3, we would end up with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p\\big(x,z \\big) = \\pi\\big(z(1)\\big)p\\big(x(1)=1|z(1)\\big) * p\\big(z(2)|z(1)\\big) * p\\big(x(2)=1|z(2)\\big) * p\\big(z(3)|z(2)\\big) * p\\big(x(3)=0|z(3)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we can then update by utilizing our matrices $A$ and $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$p\\big(x,z \\big) = \\pi\\big(z(1)\\big)B\\big(z(2),x(2)=1\\big) * A\\big(z(1),z(2)\\big) * B\\big(z(2),x(2)=1\\big) * A\\big(z(2),z(3)\\big) * B\\big(z(3),x(3)=0\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, at this point we can see that there are multiple values that $z$ can take on, and that in order to find $p(x)$ we must marginalize out $z$, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$\\sum_{z_1 = 1..M,..,z_3=1..M}\\pi\\big(z(1)\\big)B\\big(z(2),x(2)=1\\big) * A\\big(z(1),z(2)\\big) * B\\big(z(2),x(2)=1\\big) * A\\big(z(2),z(3)\\big) * B\\big(z(3),x(3)=0\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that since $M$ is 2, and we have $T =3$ observations, there are going to be $2^3$ different operations that need to be performed in order to marginalize out $z$. That would be very messy to write out, be we will calculate it in code below:"
