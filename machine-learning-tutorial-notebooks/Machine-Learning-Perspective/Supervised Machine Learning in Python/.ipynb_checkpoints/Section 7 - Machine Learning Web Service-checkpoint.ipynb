    "* we are going to use a random forest classifier\n",
    "* in the real world this may be run periodically when new data becomes available \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\n",
    "* `app.py` - uses tornado framework, python library\n",
    "* create an endpoint called predict, which takes in one parameter \"input\"\n",
    "* application will make prediction using model, return JSON with prediction {\"prediction\": k}\n",
    "* going to make it a POST, even though POSTs technically should be used for requests which change data on a server \n",
    "* if we made it a get request, you would see the entire array in the URL\n",

    "* `app_caller.py`\n",
    "* this will simulate how an external application would call the API\n",
    "* choose a digit at random, call web service to make prediction, print prediction + true label, show image "
