<h1 id="5.-Customer-Segmentation">5. Customer Segmentation<a class="anchor-link" href="#5.-Customer-Segmentation">&#182;</a></h1><p>The vast majority of my articles are written with intention of highlighting some mathematical or computer science concept and tying it in to a real world example. In other words, we are operating as follows:</p>
$$\text{Determine concept to teach} \longrightarrow \text{Find problem to demonstrate concept}$$<p>For instance, in the case of Bayesian Classifiers I <em>decided</em> that I wanted to cover that particular concept and all of it's inner workings, and I then found problems (that I encountered working as a data scientist) in order to demonstrate how a Bayes Classifier would work in the real world.</p>
<p>However, this is not how things work in the real world! TODO: Mention taleb ideas relating to trying to fit real world into Platonic framework (when it may not really be that way). In reality, a data scientist is often given a vague problem that needs solving by making use of data. If lucky, they will be given a stand alone data set (i.e. a csv), but often they may not even have that, leaving them to wrangle the necessary data from databases, API's, and other sources.</p>
<p>I want to take some time to write an article that demonstrates how to handle being confronted with a data set and simply being tasked to "explore" it and find something useful (known as <strong>data mining</strong>). This post will specifically be based on the exploration of the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail">online retail data set</a>.</p>
<h3 id="5.1-Background-and-Context">5.1 Background and Context<a class="anchor-link" href="#5.1-Background-and-Context">&#182;</a></h3><p>Assume that you are a data scientist for an online retail store. Management comes to you saying that they have a set of customer transaction data over the course of ~ 1 year. They want you to simply explore and see if there is anything interesting; in other words, are there <strong>patterns</strong> in the data that could be relevant to marketing, <strong>trends</strong> that could be useful in customer prediction, and so on. We are starting with a <em>very</em> blank canvas; where do we begin?</p>
<p>There is a "general" exploration framework that is generally followed by most data scientists. It almost always starts with <strong>data preparation</strong> and <strong>basic exploration</strong>. Data preparation consists of <em>gathering</em> relevant data into a single location. For example, if you are an energy utility and you have customers that have billing and energy usage data held in different databases, this phase may consist of querying the different databases and exporting the desired tables (potentially for specific time intervals) to a specific format (csv). Once the relevant data is in a desirable format, the next phase consists of basic exploration. What exactly is meant by that? Well, that consists of things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine size and shape of data set</li>
<li>Inspect variables of interest</li>
<li>Gather metrics about columns</li>
<li>Potentially perform different groupings</li>
<li>Feature generation </li>
</ul>
<p>For this post we are starting at the tail end of the data preparation phase (thankfully a csv has already been created for us). For that we will be using the python scientific computing stack-pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc. So, without further ado, let's begin!</p>
<h3 id="5.2-Data-Preparation">5.2 Data Preparation<a class="anchor-link" href="#5.2-Data-Preparation">&#182;</a></h3><p>To start, we can load our necessary libraries, and then load our data set:</p>

<p>We immediately get an idea of the variables available to us for analysis, as well as where we may have particular gaps (null values). Right from the get go we see that there are <code>~25%</code> of transactions that do not have an associated <code>CustomerID</code>. Based on the data that is readily available, it is impossible to impute these values. Because the vast majority of inferences that we will try and make will tie back to a particular customer, these rows can be dropped:</p>

<li><code>StockCode</code>: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.</li>
<li><code>Description</code>: Product (item) name. Nominal.</li>
<li><code>Quantity</code>: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.</li>
<li><code>InvoiceDate</code>: Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.</li>
<li><code>UnitPrice</code>: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.</li>
<li><code>CustomerID</code>: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.</li>
<li><code>Country</code>: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.</li>
